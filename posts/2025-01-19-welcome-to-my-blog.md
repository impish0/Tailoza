---

# Welcome!

This is my first post on my new blog. I've built this site using a simple static site generator that converts markdown files to HTML.

## Features

This blog supports:

- **Markdown** formatting for easy writing
- *Italics* and **bold** text
- [Links](https://example.com) to other sites
- `Inline code` and code blocks
- Automatic RSS feed generation

## Code Example

Here's a simple Python function:

```
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## What's Next?

I'll be writing about various topics including:

- Programming and development
- Technology trends
- Personal projects
- And much more!

Stay tuned for more posts. You can subscribe to the [RSS feed](/rss.xml) to get updates.
