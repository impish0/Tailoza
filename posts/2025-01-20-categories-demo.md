This post demonstrates the new category system. You can now organize your posts by categories!

## How Categories Work

Categories are defined in the frontmatter of your post:

```yaml
---
title: My Post
date: 2025-01-20
categories: Technology, Programming
---
```

## Multiple Categories

You can assign multiple categories to a single post by separating them with commas. Each category will get its own page listing all posts in that category.

## Category Pages

Each category automatically gets its own page at `/categories/category-name.html` where visitors can see all posts in that category.

## Benefits

- Better organization of content
- Easier navigation for readers
- SEO benefits from topical grouping
- Automatic category page generation

## Implementation Details

The category system includes:

1. Frontmatter parsing for categories
2. Category page generation
3. Category links on posts and index
4. Styled category display

This makes it easy to organize your blog content by topic!
