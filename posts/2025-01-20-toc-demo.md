This post demonstrates the automatic table of contents generation. Since we have `toc: true` in the frontmatter, a TOC will be generated from all the headings below.

## Getting Started with TOC

The table of contents is automatically generated from your post headings. It appears in a nice card at the top of your post.

### How It Works

The TOC generator:
- Extracts all headings from your post
- Excludes H1 (post title)
- Ignores headings inside code blocks
- Creates anchor links for smooth scrolling

### Enabling TOC

Simply add `toc: true` to your post's frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: My Post
date: 2025-01-20
toc: true
---
```

## Advanced Features

The TOC has several nice features built in.

### Automatic ID Generation

Each heading gets a unique ID based on its text. Special characters are removed and spaces become hyphens.

### Smooth Scrolling

Clicking a TOC link smoothly scrolls to that section.

### Responsive Design

The TOC card is responsive and looks great on all devices.

## Code Block Example

Here's a code example to show that headings in code blocks are ignored:

```markdown
## This Heading Won't Appear in TOC
Because it's inside a code block!
```

## Styling Options

The TOC uses your site's color scheme automatically.

### Custom Styling

You can customize the TOC appearance by modifying the CSS:
- `.toc-card` - The main container
- `.toc-title` - The "Table of Contents" heading
- `.toc a` - The links

### Visual Indicators

Each TOC item has a "â€º" indicator for better visual hierarchy.

## Conclusion

The table of contents feature makes long posts much easier to navigate!
