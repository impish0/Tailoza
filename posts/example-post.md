This is the ultimate example post showing off everything Tailoza can do. Use this as a template for your own posts.

## Images

You can add images three ways:

### Local Images

### External Images

### Images with Specific Paths

## Code Blocks

Tailoza supports syntax highlighting for all major languages:

### JavaScript
```javascript
// A simple React component
const BlogPost = ({ title, content, date }) => {
    const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);
    
    return (
        <article>
            <h1>{title}</h1>
            <time>{date}</time>
            <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: content }} />
            <button onClick={() => setLikes(likes + 1)}>
                üëç {likes}
            </button>
        </article>
    );
};
```

### Python
```python
def parse_markdown(content):
    """Convert markdown to HTML with frontmatter support"""
    if content.startswith('---'):
        _, frontmatter, body = content.split('---', 2)
        metadata = yaml.safe_load(frontmatter)
        html = markdown.markdown(body)
        return metadata, html
    return {}, markdown.markdown(content)
```

### CSS
```css
/* Tailoza's clean styling */
.post-preview {
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
    padding-bottom: 2rem;
    border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);
}

.post-preview:hover h2 {
    color: var(--primary);
}
```

### Plain Code Block (no language)
```
This is a code block without syntax highlighting.
It's useful for configuration files, logs, or plain text.
The copy button still works!
```

## Tables

Tables are great for comparing options:

| Feature | Tailoza | WordPress | Medium |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Speed | Lightning ‚ö° | Slow | Fast |
| Control | Total | Some | None |
| Cost | Free | $5-500/mo | Free-$50/mo |
| Markdown | Native | Plugin | Limited |
| Privacy | Full | Questionable | None |

## Lists

### Unordered Lists
- Simple bullet points
- Clean and readable
- Can be nested
  - Like this
  - And this
    - Even deeper
- Back to top level

### Ordered Lists
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item with substeps:
   1. Substep one
   2. Substep two
4. Fourth item

### Task Lists
- [x] Create blog post
- [x] Add images
- [ ] Share on social media
- [ ] Respond to comments

## Text Formatting

You can make text **bold** or *italic* or ***both***. You can also ~~strike through~~ text that's no longer relevant.

## Blockquotes

> "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."
> 
> This is especially true for starting a blog. Don't wait for the perfect platform or the perfect post idea.

## Horizontal Rules

Sometimes you need a visual break:

---

Like that. Simple but effective.

## Inline Code

You can mention `variables`, `function names()`, or `file-paths.md` inline. Great for technical writing.

## The Power of Simplicity

This post demonstrates that you don't need a complex CMS to create beautiful, functional blog posts. With Tailoza, you write in markdown, run a build command, and get a fast, clean website.

### Why This Matters

1. **No Database** = No security vulnerabilities
2. **Plain Files** = Version control with Git
3. **Static HTML** = Blazing fast load times
4. **Your Content** = You own everything

## Conclusion

Copy this post, modify it for your needs, and start blogging. The web needs more independent voices, not more Medium posts behind paywalls.

Remember: **Done is better than perfect**. Ship it.
