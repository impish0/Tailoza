# Tailoza

I spent a weekend building this because I was tired of the BS. I have done my playing elsewhere...

And the cognitive load it takes just to lob my un-filtered thoughts onto the internet with every other platform makes writing things suck. Every blogging platform wants you to install 47 dependencies, configure a database, and sacrifice a goat to the SEO gods just to publish a simple post.

Or, it's a static site generator with unimaginable config files and massive showcase of broken, un-documented, out-of-date themes.

or its a subscription...

That's insane.

## Here's the Deal

I built Tailoza because I wanted to write, not wrestle with config files.

You know what I wanted?

- Write in Markdown

- Run one command

- Get a beautiful site

- Deploy anywhere


That's it. No React. No databases. No build pipelines that require a PhD, Caffeine, or more  to understand.

## The 2-Minute Setup (I'm Not Kidding)

```bash

git clone https://github.com/impish0/Tailoza.git

cd Tailoza

```

Now write your first post:

```bash

echo "---

title: My First Post

date: 2025-01-20

---


Hello world. I'm blogging!" > posts/my-first-post.md

```

Build it:

```bash

python3 build.py

```

Done. Your blog is in the `output/` folder.

Upload that folder literally anywhere that serves HTML. GitHub Pages, Netlify, your old shared hosting from 2003 - doesn't matter.

(if you dont know how to do that, i'll make some tutorials soon)

## What You're Getting

**The Good Stuff:**

- Beautiful shadcn-inspired design (light AND dark mode)

- Categories that actually work

- Auto-generated table of contents

- SEO that Google likes

- RSS feed for the old-school readers

- Syntax highlighting for your code and markdown

- Zero JavaScript bloat


**The Technical Stuff** (for those who care):

- 100% static HTML output (almost)

- Python 3.6+ (only needed for building)

- Processes hundreds of posts in seconds

- Mobile-first responsive design

- Full markdown post support

## How to Use This Thing

### Writing Posts

Drop markdown files in `posts/`:

```markdown

---

title: Why Your Business Needs This

date: 2025-01-20

description: The truth about static sites

categories: Business, Tech

---

Your content here. Write like a human.

```

### Make It Yours

Edit `config.json`:

```json

{

"site_title": "Your Blog Name",

"site_url": "https://yourdomain.com",

"site_description": "What you're about",

"author": "You",

"theme": "dark" // or "light" if you're into that

}

```

### Categories (They Just Work)

Add categories to any post:

```yaml

categories: Marketing, Business, Whatever

```

Boom. Automatic category pages at `/categories/marketing.html`.

### Table of Contents

Got a long post? Add `toc: true` to the frontmatter. It'll generate a nice floating TOC from your headings. Your readers will thank you.

## The Philosophy (Why I Built This)

I've built million-dollar businesses. I've also wasted countless hours on "modern" blogging platforms (all of them)

Here's what I learned:

- **Simple beats complex** - Every. Single. Time.

- **Fast beats features** - Your readers don't care about your framework

- **Writing beats configuring** - Spend time on content, not setup

This tool does one thing: **turns markdown into a beautiful blog**.

No more. No less.

## Deploy This Thing

### GitHub Pages

1. Build: `python3 build.py`

2. Push the `output/` folder

3. Turn on Pages in settings

4. You're live

### Anywhere Else

1. Build: `python3 build.py`

2. Upload the `output/` folder

3. That's it

I'm not kidding. It's just HTML files.

## Want to Contribute?

Cool. I built this in a weekend, so there's probably room for improvement.

- Find a bug? Open an issue

- Want a feature? PR it

- Think something sucks? Tell me why

Just keep it simple. That's the whole point.

## One More Thing

Stop overthinking your blog setup.

Write some things that matter to you, and send it somewhere.

Tailoza gets out of your way so you can focus on what matters: **your content**.

Now stop reading this README and go write something.

P.P.S. - If you are mad about yet another blog repo - consider this: I built it for me, not you. But you are free to use it, copy it or ignore it.
