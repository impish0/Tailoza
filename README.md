# Tailoza Static Blog

I spent a weekend building this because I wanted a actually simple blog with a markdown backend.

The cognitive load required to lob my un-filtered thoughts onto the internet seemed unnecessary...

Of course, you could pay a subscription to a hosting provider, but I don't want to.

## Here's the Deal

I built Tailoza because I wanted to write, not wrestle with config files.

**Tailoza Lets You:**
- Write in Markdown (eg. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/))

- Run one command

- Get a beautiful site

- Deploy anywhere

That's it. No React. No databases. No subscriptions!


## The 2-Minute Setup (I'm Not Kidding)

```bash

git clone https://github.com/impish0/Tailoza.git

cd Tailoza

```

Now write your first post:

```bash

echo "---

title: My First Post
date: 2025-01-20

---

Hello world. I'm blogging!" > posts/my-first-post.md

```

Build it:

```bash

python3 build.py

```

Done. Your blog is in the `output/` folder.

Upload that folder literally anywhere that serves HTML. GitHub Pages, Netlify, your old shared hosting from 2003 - doesn't matter.

(if you don't know how to do that, i'll make some tutorials soon)


## What You're Getting

**The Good Stuff:**

- Beautiful shadcn-inspired design (light & dark mode)

- Categories For Posts

- Auto-generated table of contents

- Decent SEO 

- RSS feed

- Syntax highlighting


## How to Use This Thing


### Writing Posts

Drop markdown files in `posts/`. Here's all the frontmatter options:

```markdown
---
title: Your Post Title                               # Required
date: 2024-01-20                                    # Required (YYYY-MM-DD)
description: Short SEO description                   # Shows in previews & search results
categories: Business, Tech, Whatever                 # Comma-separated, creates category pages
keywords: seo, keywords, for, google                # Optional SEO boost
author: Your Name                                   # Optional, defaults to config
image: hero-image.jpg                               # Social media preview image
toc: true                                          # Auto-generates table of contents
---

Your content here. Write like a human.
```

**Pro tip**: Check out `posts/example-post.md` for a full demo of every feature in action.

### Draft Posts

Working on something not ready for prime time? Prefix your filename with underscore:

```
_draft-post.md      # Won't be published
_ideas.md           # Ignored by build
my-post.md          # This one gets built
```

Simple. No "draft: true" nonsense. Just underscore it.

### Make It Yours


Edit `config.json`:

```json

{

"site_title": "Your Blog Name",

"site_url": "https://yourdomain.com",

"site_description": "What you're about",

"author": "You",

"theme": "dark" // or "light" if you're into that

}

```

### Images (Drop 'em In)

Put images in the `images/` folder. Reference them in your posts:

```markdown
![Your alt text here](image-name.jpg)
```

Whatever you put in the square brackets becomes the alt text. Be descriptive - it helps with SEO and accessibility:

```markdown
![Team celebrating product launch](team-photo.jpg)     # Good
![IMG_1234](team-photo.jpg)                           # Bad
![](team-photo.jpg)                                   # Terrible
```

You can also use the full path if you want:

```markdown
![Description](images/image-name.jpg)
```

Both work. The build process sorts out the paths.

### Favicon

Want a favicon? Drop one of these in your project root or assets folder:
- `favicon.ico`
- `favicon.png` 
- `favicon.svg`

The build finds it and adds it to your site. No config needed.

### Categories (They Just Work)


Add categories to any post:

```yaml

categories: Marketing, Business, Whatever

```

Boom. Automatic category pages at `/categories/marketing.html`.

### Social Preview Images

Want a nice preview when your post gets shared on Twitter/LinkedIn/Whatever?

```yaml
image: hero-image.jpg
```

Put it in your frontmatter. The image shows up in social cards. That's it.

### Table of Contents


Got a long post? Add `toc: true` to the frontmatter. It'll generate a nice floating TOC from your headings. Your readers will thank you.

## The Philosophy (Why I Built This)


I've built million-dollar businesses. I've also wasted countless hours on "modern" blogging platforms (all of them)

Here's what I learned:

- **Simple beats complex** - Every. Single. Time.

- **Fast beats features** - Your readers don't care about your framework

- **Writing beats configuring** - Spend time on content, not setup

This tool does one thing: **turns markdown into a beautiful blog**.

No more. No less.


## Deploy This Thing


### GitHub Pages


1. Build: `python3 build.py`
2. Push the `output/` folder
3. Turn on Pages in settings
4. You're live


### Anywhere Else


1. Build: `python3 build.py`
2. Upload the `output/` folder
3. That's it

I'm not kidding. It's just HTML files.


## Want to Contribute?


Cool. I built this in a weekend, so there's probably room for improvement.

- Find a bug? Open an issue
- Want a feature? PR it
- Think something sucks? Tell me why

Just keep it simple. That's the whole point.


## One More Thing


Stop overthinking your blog setup.

Write some things that matter to you, and send it somewhere.

Tailoza gets out of your way so you can focus on what matters: **your content**.

Now stop reading this README and go write something.
